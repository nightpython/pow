# Word of Wisdom TCP Server
The Word of Wisdom TCP Server incorporates the Hashcash algorithm to prevent abuse and mitigate Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The Hashcash algorithm is a proof-of-work system designed to deter spam and other malicious activities by requiring a moderate amount of computational effort.This algorithm is chosen because it is widely using in blockchain-based systems and is considered to be a computationally expensive algorithm

## Usage
To run the server and client from Makefile, or both from "start" command

## Configuration
The server and client configurations are stored in the config/config.yaml file.
